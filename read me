Step 1: Hardware Setup

I have a Raspberry Pi Model B (Rev-1), GY521 (InvenSense MPU6050), breadboard & some male-female wire.

*Connect Raspberry Pi 3V3 to GY521 VCC

*Connect Raspberry Pi GND to GY521 GND

*Connect Raspberry Pi SCL to GY521 SCL

*Connect Raspberry Pi SDA to GY521 SDA

Step 2: Workflow

*Install I2C dev library. Under Raspbian, use

sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev
*Configure I2C pins using adafruit guide

*Install wiringPi using https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/ 

*Make sure your Raspberry Pi can detect the device attached to the I2C interface.

If detected, then you will see an address with below command. In my case, the address is 0x68 which is then used in the code.

i2cdetect -y 0 # Rev 1 
i2cdetect -y 1 # Rev 2
*Use this sample code from my github

*Use the Makefile and type

$make i2ctest
$sudo ./i2ctest
You should now see the sensor data value in the screen.
